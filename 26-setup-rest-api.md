# 2.6 Setup REST API

This step will show you how to setup your node's REST API.

Open your web browser and go to [http://yourserverip:6861](http://yourserverip:6861)

```
http://yourserverip:6861
```

#### Encrypt your API key

To encrypt your API key, do the following;

click on 'Utils' tab then "/utils/hash/secure"

Simply insert your own 'custom api key' in the 'Value' section then click 'Try it Out!'

Record your 'custom api key' and the 'hash' value which was generated by the previous command

You will see it in 'Response Body' section

> "message":"test",
>
> "hash":"JDJkZrg24XwvBgBUi6PgpHzrAFgeefb7nU8LJPRR58ga"

#### Edit REST API section of your TN-mainnet.conf

You need to edit your TN-mainnet.conf file again.[ Section 2.4](/24-edit-conf-file.md)

##### \# Node's REST API settings

> bind-address = ~~"0.0.0.0"~~

Change bind-address with 127.0.0.1 , you will only be able to access to your REST API \(swagger\) in local

```
bind-address = "127.0.0.1"
```

> api-key-hash = "~~H6nsiifwYKYEx6YzYD7woP1XCn72RVvx6tC1zjjLXqsu~~"

Change api-key-hash with your own hash key noted one step before.

```
api-key-hash = "JDJkZrg24XwvBgBUi6PgpHzrAFgeefb7nU8LJPRR58ga"
```

You will need to restart your node to apply config change.
