# 2.1 Create Directory

This step will show you how to create a new directory for your node files.

For this step you need to login into your server with your new ''username'' created [few step ago](/13create-node-user.md).

* Create your node directory with this following command:

```
sudo mkdir /opt/turtle
```

* Go into your directory with this following command:

```
cd /opt/turtle
```
